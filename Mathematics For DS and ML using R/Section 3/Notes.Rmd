Scalar: constant  
Eg: 3, 8, 5

Vector: Single row or column of numbers 
Eg: [-1, 2, 5] or
-     -
| -1  |
|  2  |
|  5  |
-     -

Matrix: a rectangular collection of numbers.  
Dimensions of a matrix refer to the number or rows and columns. ( r x c )  
Mij element is at i row and j column  
Vectors are represented as single row or column, which means they are subset of matrix.  
Matrix of dimension 1 x c ( Row Vector ) or r x 1 ( Column Vector )  
And scalars 1 x 1 ( sort of )  

Vectors are used to represent a location in space. Each entry represents a dimension.  

str(value) => shows structure of value

# Lecture 1
```{r}
# Defining a vector
# 1. Using c()
v1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4)

# 2. Using : operator
v2 = 1:4

# 3. Using seq()
v3 = seq(from = 1, to = 4, by = 1)
v3 = seq(1, 4, 1)

# 4. Using rep() => repeat
v4 = rep(2, 4)

print(v1)
print(v2)
print(v3)
print(v4)


# Defining a matrix
# 1. Using matrix()
m1 = matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# 2. Using rbind()
m2 = rbind(1:3, 4: 6)

# 3. Using cbind()
m3 = cbind(1:3, 4: 6)

print(m1)
print(m2)
print(m3)
